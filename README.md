Qt-MySQL-Driver-For-Windows
===========================

In C++ Qt framework SQlite and ODBC driver is installed by default. but there is no MySql driver. I build this driver compile the source code of Qt. If you want to use mysql in Qt download this repo. Copy this 4 files ( libqsqlmysql4.a, libqsqlmysqld4.a, qsqlmysql4.dll, qsqlmysqld4.dll  ) in this location - C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.7.4\mingw\plugins\sqldrivers and copy libmysql.dll file in this location C:\windows. Now you can use MySql in Qt.
